Här kommer första kapitlet ur Mary Shelleys Frankenstein

##H2-header

I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. My 
ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several 
public situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who knew him for his 
integrity and indefatigable attention to public business. He passed his younger days perpetually 
occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying 
early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family.

###H3-header

As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating 
them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through 
numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending 
disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had 
formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in 
the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived 
unknown and in wretchedness. 

My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply 
grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He bitterly deplored the false pride 
which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no 
time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again 
through his credit and assistance.

####H4-header

Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten months before my father 
discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated 
in a mean street near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. 
Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was 
sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure 
some respectable employment in a merchant's house. The interval was, consequently, spent in 
inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at 
length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, 
incapable of any exertion.

#####H5-header

His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with despair that their little 
fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort 
possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support her in her adversity. She 
procured plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely 
sufficient to support life.

######H6-header

Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in 
attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, 
leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beaufort's coffin 
weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor 
girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to 
Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation. Two years after this event Caroline became 
his wife.
